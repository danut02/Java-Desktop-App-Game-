This is my first 2D game created with Java, without any framework. I need to mention that nobody helped me with it, so I did it on my own.
You can find the code of the game in the " src " directory, and the game executable (.exe) in the " Dangerous Corners " directory, so, you can download it.
If you have some problems with the resolution, let's follow the next steps :

    1) Go the the desktop
    2) Right click
    3) Click on "Display settings"
    4) Find "scale and layout" section
    5) Switch it to " 125% (Recommended) "

Enjoy it!
